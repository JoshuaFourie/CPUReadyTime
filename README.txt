‚ùì Troubleshooting

Real-Time Monitoring Issues
Problem: Real-time monitoring not starting
Solutions:
- Verify vCenter connection is active
- Check CPU Readiness metric availability in vCenter
- Ensure hosts are connected and not in maintenance mode
- Try restarting monitoring after reconnecting to vCenter

Problem: Real-time data shows incorrect values
Solutions:
- Verify vCenter performance statistics levels
- Check that CPU Ready metrics are enabled
- Compare with vCenter UI to validate values
- Use "Verify Data" button to check conversion accuracy

Connection Issues
Problem: Cannot connect to vCenter
Solutions:
- Verify vCenter server address and credentials
- Check network connectivity and firewall settings
- Ensure vCenter is running and accessible on port 443
- Try with administrator account
- Verify SSL certificate acceptance

Data Retrieval Issues
Problem: "No CPU Ready data found"
Solutions:
- Check vCenter statistics levels (Administration > System Configuration > Statistics)
- Verify CPU metrics are being collected at appropriate intervals
- Try different time periods (start with "Last Day")
- Ensure ESXi hosts are connected and collecting performance data
- Check vCenter disk space for statistics storage

Performance Issues
Problem: Application runs slowly with real-time monitoring
Solutions:
- Reduce number of monitored hosts if possible
- Increase monitoring interval in real-time dashboard settings
- Clear old real-time data using "Clear History" button
- Close other applications to free memory
- Consider using historical analysis for large environments

Import Issues
Problem: CSV/Excel import fails or shows wrong values
Solutions:
- Verify file contains "Time" column and "Ready for [hostname]" columns
- Check timestamp format compatibility
- Ensure CPU Ready values are in correct units (milliseconds for historical)
- Try saving Excel files as CSV format
- Use manual interval selection if auto-detection fails

AI Recommendation Issues
Problem: AI generates no recommendations
Solutions:
- Ensure sufficient performance data is available
- Try different consolidation strategies
- Lower target reduction percentage
- Verify all hosts have adequate monitoring data
- Check that CPU Ready values are within expected ranges

üîí Security Considerations

vCenter Credentials
- Credentials are not stored permanently or logged
- Use dedicated read-only vCenter account when possible
- SSL verification disabled for self-signed certificates (common in vCenter deployments)
- Connection is automatically closed when application exits
- Real-time monitoring stops when vCenter connection is lost

Data Privacy
- No performance data is transmitted outside your network
- All analysis is performed locally on your machine
- Real-time data stored locally in encrypted SQLite database
- Data can be cleared manually using application controls
- No telemetry or usage data collection

Real-Time Database Security
- SQLite database stored locally with restricted access
- Database contains only performance metrics and timestamps
- No sensitive vCenter credentials stored in database
- Database can be relocated or encrypted using OS-level tools
