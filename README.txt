## üéØ Quick Start Guide

### Method 1: vCenter Integration (Recommended)
1. **Connect to vCenter**
   - Enter vCenter server IP/hostname
   - Enter username and password
   - Click "Connect to vCenter"
   - Wait for "Connected ‚úì" status

2. **Select Time Period**
   - Choose from: Real-Time, Last Day, Last Week, Last Month, Last Year
   - See automatic date range calculation

3. **Fetch Data**
   - Click "Fetch CPU Ready Data"
   - Wait for data collection (progress dialog shows status)
   - Success message shows hosts found and records collected

4. **Analyze Performance**
   - Click "Calculate CPU Ready %"
   - Review results table and time series chart
   - Check for hosts with high CPU Ready percentages

5. **Plan Consolidation**
   - Select hosts to remove (Ctrl+click for multiple)
   - Click "Analyze Impact"
   - Review workload redistribution and risk assessment

### Method 2: File Import
1. **Export Data from vCenter**
   - Export CPU Ready performance data as CSV/Excel
   - Ensure columns include: Time, "Ready for [hostname]"

2. **Import Files**
   - Click "Import CSV/Excel Files"
   - Select your exported files
   - Files are validated automatically

3. **Follow steps 4-5 from Method 1**

## üìä Understanding the Results

### CPU Ready % Interpretation
- **0-5%**: Excellent performance, no CPU contention
- **5-10%**: Good performance, minor contention during peaks
- **10-20%**: Moderate contention, monitor closely
- **20%+**: High contention, performance impact likely

### Impact Assessment Levels
- **‚úÖ LOW IMPACT** (<5% increase): Safe to proceed with consolidation
- **‚ö° MODERATE IMPACT** (5-10% increase): Monitor closely after consolidation
- **‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH IMPACT** (10-15% increase): May cause performance issues
- **üî¥ VERY HIGH IMPACT** (15%+ increase): Likely to cause significant problems

### Consolidation Efficiency
- Measures workload reduction percentage per host removed
- Higher efficiency = better consolidation candidates
- Typical good efficiency: 10-25% per host

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Time Period Selection Guidelines
- **Real-Time**: Last hour, 20-second intervals - for immediate troubleshooting
- **Last Day**: Last 24 hours, 5-minute intervals - for daily analysis
- **Last Week**: Last 7 days, 30-minute intervals - for weekly trends
- **Last Month**: Last 30 days, 2-hour intervals - for capacity planning
- **Last Year**: Last 365 days, daily intervals - for long-term trends

### Multi-Host Removal Strategies
1. **Incremental Approach**: Remove 1-2 hosts at a time, analyze impact
2. **Workload-Based**: Remove hosts with lowest CPU Ready percentages first
3. **Efficiency-Based**: Target hosts that provide best consolidation efficiency
4. **Risk-Balanced**: Balance infrastructure reduction with performance risk

### Data Export Tips
When exporting from vCenter:
- Use Performance > Advanced view
- Select CPU Ready (millisecond) metric
- Choose appropriate time range and interval
- Export as CSV for best compatibility

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
**Problem**: Cannot connect to vCenter
**Solutions**:
- Verify vCenter server address and credentials
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure vCenter is running and accessible
- Try with administrator account
- Check for firewall blocking (port 443)

### Data Retrieval Issues
**Problem**: "No CPU Ready data found"
**Solutions**:
- Check vCenter statistics levels (Administration > System Configuration > Statistics)
- Verify CPU metrics are being collected
- Try different time periods (start with "Last Day")
- Ensure ESXi hosts are connected and not in maintenance mode

### Performance Issues
**Problem**: Application runs slowly
**Solutions**:
- Use shorter time periods for initial analysis
- Limit to essential hosts only
- Close other applications to free memory
- Consider using "Last Week" or "Last Month" for large environments

### Import Issues
**Problem**: CSV/Excel import fails
**Solutions**:
- Verify file contains "Time" column and "Ready for [hostname]" columns
- Check for proper timestamp format (ISO 8601)
- Ensure data is not corrupted
- Try saving Excel files as CSV format

## üîí Security Considerations

### vCenter Credentials
- Credentials are not stored permanently
- Use read-only vCenter account when possible
- SSL verification disabled for self-signed certificates (common in vCenter)
- Connection is automatically closed when application exits

### Data Privacy
- No performance data is transmitted outside your network
- All analysis is performed locally
- Data is stored in memory only during session
- No data persistence between sessions

## üÜò Support & Contact

### Common Error Messages
- **"Invalid interval"**: Try different time period or use file import
- **"No hosts found"**: Check vCenter connection and host status
- **"Calculation error"**: Verify data format and try re-importing
- **"Connection timeout"**: Check network connectivity to vCenter

### Getting Help
For issues or questions:
1. Check this README for troubleshooting steps
2. Verify system requirements are met
3. Test with a simple scenario first (single host, short time period)
4. Check vCenter logs for performance data collection issues
